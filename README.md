# A Blogging Engine written in .NET 8.0 and ASP.NET Blazor server side

At a high level this is the functionality this will support
- Dynamic preview of blog posts
- Preview image recommendations based on AI
- Text recommendations using AI
- Automatic tagging suggestions
- Content using Markdown
- Syntax highlighting
- Mermaid diagrams

The following projects helped make this possible (THANK YOU!)

- [MarkDig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) A C# library that supports markdown to html
- [PrismJS](https://github.com/PrismJS) Syntax highlighting
